Rent And Lease Details Frontend
===============================

Supplying business rental information is an important activity that allows the VOA (valuation office agency) to calculate the rateable value of a property. 
Rateable value represents the open market annual rental value of a business/ non-domestic property. 

This repository contains the RALD (rent and lease details) form (aka FOR - Form Of Return) application - it is the website that allows users to submit their rental information to the VOA.

* FOR-HOD-ADAPTER (you will need to provide a stub for this or you can stub method calls in HODConnector.scala)
